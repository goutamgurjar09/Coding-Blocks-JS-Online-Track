            // This handler would be triggered if e.stopPropagation() is not called in the inner element's handler
            console.log('parent')
        })

        child.addEventListener('click',(e)=>{
            // This handler is triggered when the inner element is clicked
            console.log('child')
            // Stop further propagation (bubbling and capturing)
           //e.stopPropagation()          //isko nhi lgayege to jb bhi hm child div pr click krege to dono print/log hoga-> parent and child element
        })




//----------------

//This is bcz of Event Bubbling
//In this example, if you click the inner element, only "Inner element clicked" will be logged, and the outer element's handler won't be triggered 
//because e.stopPropagation() prevents the event from reaching the outer element during the bubbling phase.


//---------------------------
// Now, let's understand what happens when you click the "Click me" button:

// Click on the Button (#child):

// You click on the button with the id "child."
// Event Handling on the Button:

// The click event is first handled on the button itself because it is the target element with the event listener.
// "Child element clicked" is logged to the console.
// Event Bubbling:

// After handling the event on the button, the click event "bubbles up" to its parent element, the div with the id "parent."
// The click event triggers the event listener on the parent div.
// "Parent element clicked" is logged to the console.
// Propagation Stops:

// The event propagation stops at this point because there are no more ancestors to propagate to.

//If you didn't want the event to bubble up, you could use e.stopPropagation() in the child button's event listener.


//------------------\

//The e.stopPropagation() method is used within an event handler to stop the further propagation of the current event in the capturing or bubbling phases.
